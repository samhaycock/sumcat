Description: A package that is an ensemble for categorical analysis. That is 
  there is one modeling function that takes in a formula, training data set, 
  and a test data set. Which stores the four types of classification models:
  Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Linear 
  Dependence Analysis, in a single object. We have overwritten three functions:
  summary, rank, and plot, which take in this object and return results for 
  each.
